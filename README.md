Task to assess periprocedural effect of MRgFUS ablative thalamotomy on value based decision making


## Description

Intending to be a portable; OS/ device agnostic Restless Bandit task based on Daw 'Cortical Substrates' (aim to have a WebGL build hosted on github pages). Currently builds ok for iOS; is in testing.


## Getting Started
To build you'd need to download Unity and import project and build yourself.



### Dependencies

Unity 2022.3.16f1; 2D (URP)
Packages in package list currently not clean and include packages from other projects

for iOS; xCode


### Builds
Follow Unity Build Process
For iOS; xCode opens etc

### Installing


### Logs, Data
At the moment need to
Need to re- connect iPad & Mac; go into xCode, then
Windows-> Devices & Simulators
Select iPad then see Installed Apps, click on Apathetic Bandit then 3 dots to Download Container.
(Suggest to Downloads for sanity)
In finder (pff) right click on the downloaded file (like .coblacblah.xcappdata) and click Show Package Contents.
Then we're in :
Downloads/com.TheChildrenOfTheBandit.ApatheticBandit2D 2024-04-27 20:35.30.xcappdata/AppData/Documents
So it's Show Package Contents -> AppData/Documents and they are there!
